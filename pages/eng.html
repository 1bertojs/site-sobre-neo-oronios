            The neuron, or nerve cell, is the fundamental unit of the animal
            nervous system. It is a highly specialized cell found not only in
            the brain and the digestive system but also in the spinal cord and
            peripheral nerves throughout the body.

              Its main function is communication. Neurons are responsible for
              receiving, processing, transmitting, and storing information
              through electrical and chemical signals known as nerve impulses.
              This communication network forms the basis of all nervous
              functions, including thought, memory, movement, sensations, and
              the regulation of automatic processes such as digestion.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Soma (Cell Body): It is the central part of the neuron, housing
                the nucleus (containing DNA) and most of the cytoplasm and
                organelles (such as mitochondria and the Golgi complex). The
                soma is the metabolic center of the cell, responsible for
                protein synthesis and for generating the energy needed for its
                activities. Its size and shape vary depending on the type of
                neuron.

                class="imagem4"
              />
              <li>
                Dendrites: These are numerous, short, and highly branched
                extensions projecting from the soma. Their main function is to
                act as the cell’s "antennas," receiving chemical stimuli
                (neurotransmitters) from other neurons or from the environment
                and converting them into electrical signals. These signals are
                then transmitted toward the cell body for processing.

              />
              <li>
                Axon: This is a single, long, thin extension specialized in
                conducting the nerve impulse away from the cell body. Its
                function is to transmit the information processed in the soma to
                other cells, which may be other neurons, muscle cells, or
                glands. Many axons are covered by a myelin sheath, a fatty
                substance that acts as an electrical insulator, significantly
                increasing the speed of impulse transmission. The final region
                of the axon, called the axon terminal or synaptic button, is
                where the electrical signal is converted into a chemical signal
                to be passed on through the synapse.
