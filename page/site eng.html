          <strong>
            The neuron, or nerve cell, is the fundamental unit of the animal
            nervous system. It is a highly specialized cell, found not only in
            the brain and the digestive system, but also in the spinal cord and
            the peripheral nerves throughout the body.

        <h2>ITS FUNCTIONS</h2>
        <p class="funcao">
          <strong>
            Its main function is communication. Neurons are responsible for
            receiving, processing, transmitting, and storing information through
            electrical and chemical signals, known as nerve impulses. This
            communication network forms the basis of all nervous functions,
            including thought, memory, movement, sensations, and the regulation
            of automatic processes such as digestion.

        <p>
          <strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Soma (Cell Body): This is the central part of the neuron, which
                contains the nucleus (with DNA) and most of the cytoplasm and
                organelles (such as mitochondria and the Golgi complex). The
                soma is the metabolic center of the cell, responsible for
                protein synthesis and for generating the energy needed for its
                activities. Its size and shape vary according to the type of
                neuron.
              </li>
              <img src="../images/Neuron_Cell_Body.png" alt="soma" />
              <li>
                Dendrites: These are numerous, short, and highly branched
                extensions that project from the soma. Their main function is to
                act as the cell’s “antennas,” receiving chemical stimuli
                (neurotransmitters) from other neurons or the environment and
                converting them into electrical signals. These signals are then
                transmitted toward the cell body for processing.
              </li>
              <img src="../images/1-partes-do-neuronio.webp" alt="dendritos" />
              <li>
                Axon: This is a single, long, and thin extension specialized in
                conducting the nerve impulse away from the cell body. Its
                function is to transmit the information processed in the soma to
                other cells, which may be other neurons, muscle cells, or
                glands. Many axons are covered by a myelin sheath, a lipid
                substance that acts as an electrical insulator, greatly
                increasing the speed of impulse transmission. The final region
                of the axon, called the axon terminal or synaptic bouton, is
                where the electrical signal is converted into a chemical signal
                to be passed on through the synapse.
